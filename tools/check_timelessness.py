"""Documentation timelessness: code says what is true now, not what changed.

The gate targets prose a reader is meant to believe. Three surfaces carry it, and
`documentation_text` is where the boundary is drawn:

  * **Comments**, from the tokenizer.
  * **Docstrings**, from the parse tree — the first-statement string of a module,
    class or function.
  * **The message a program says out loud**: the string arguments of a `raise`,
    and the message template of a logging call (the values substituted into it
    are data). A stranger meets that text at the moment something
    goes wrong, which is the worst moment to hand them a pointer they cannot
    follow or a date that explains nothing.

Every other string literal is data — a fixture, a dict key, a filename, a JSON
payload, a report line a run writes — and data is free to carry a date or a
phrase that prose may not; a checker that policed it would cry wolf on ported
code. Inside an f-string the substituted expressions are code, not prose, so the
braces and their contents are blanked before the rules read the line.

The rules, all scoped to that boundary:

  1. **Marker comments.** A comment opening with one of the three deferral
     markers is a note to a future reader that the code does not keep.
  2. **Changelog phrasing.** Prose that narrates an edit rather than the state.
     The phrase set lives in `CHANGELOG_RULES`.
  3. **Dates.** A date in prose, anywhere on the three surfaces. Dates belong in
     the record, not in the code: git carries when a line changed, and a dated
     measurement or decision is a document's job rather than a comment's. The
     allowlist beside this checker holds the few idioms where a date is part of
     something a reader can follow rather than a citation of its own; it is one
     regex per line, versioned in the repo, because that judgment accumulates
     rather than closing.

The patterns are written with the last character of each phrase bracketed
(`previousl[y]`), so this file does not match itself and can be scanned by the
same gate it implements.

The past-habitual rule carries a guard: the phrase is flagged only when a word
follows it and no passive auxiliary precedes it on the same line. In the passive
voice the same two words mean "for the purpose of" and state a present-tense
constraint, which passes; said of a subject they narrate a state the code has
left behind, which does not.

Usage
-----
    python -m tools.check_timelessness --root stigmergeia bootstrap node tasks tools tests --json timelessness.json

`--report-only` prints the same receipt and exits 0 whatever it found, for a tree
that has adopted the rule but not yet met it; exit 2 still means the check could
not run.
