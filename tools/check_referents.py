"""Referent reachability: every name a comment points at is in this repository.

The second documentation rule in CONTRIBUTING.md: if a comment or a docstring
names something, a reader holding only this repository must be able to go look at
it. A module path that exists here, a file in this tree, a symbol this package
defines, or a public URL all pass. A path into a private tree, a planning
document, or a phrase that defers the meaning to a conversation does not.

Scope is the same boundary the timelessness rule uses, and for the same reason:
`documentation_text` from `check_timelessness.py` is imported rather than
reimplemented, so both halves of the documentation rule agree on what counts as
prose — a comment, a docstring, and the message a `raise` or a logging call says
out loud. Every other string literal is data — a fixture, a dict key, a filename,
a JSON payload — and data names whatever it names.

How a line is read
------------------
1. **The allowlist masks first.** Each allow pattern from
   `referents_allowlist.txt` is blanked out of the line (replaced by spaces, so
   offsets survive). That is where the legitimate path-shaped things live: URLs,
   Hugging Face model ids, the on-disk data schema, the named external trees.
   Referent detection then runs over what is left, which means an over-broad
   allow pattern hides violations — the file says so at its top.
2. **Private-tree referents** are flagged: a path into one of the working trees
   `.gitignore` keeps out of git (research notes, the staging area for pulled
   results, the planning notes under `docs/`), a home-relative path, an absolute
   path that does not resolve inside this repository, or a bare
   planning-document name (a run of capitalised
   hyphen-joined words, a title whose head is shouted and whose tail is not, or a
   `-memo` suffix). A planning-style name that *is* a file in this tree passes,
   because the rule asks for reachability and a file here is reachable — the shape
   of the name is only evidence.
3. **Path-like tokens** are resolved against an index of the tree. The index is
   what git would publish — tracked files plus untracked ones `.gitignore` does
   not exclude — so a gitignored directory that happens to sit in a working
   checkout is not mistaken for something a reader can open. Outside a git
   checkout the index falls back to walking the directory. A token counts
   as path-like when it carries a known file extension, or starts at a top-level
   entry of the repository; a placeholder or a glob is a schema and never a
   referent. It resolves when some file or directory here ends with it, so a
   relative pointer written from a sibling module's point of view
   (`panel/server.py`) still resolves.
4. **Dotted module paths** rooted at a package this repository ships resolve to a
   module file, or to a module plus a top-level symbol that module defines. The
   package roots are read off the tree, and the resolution is static (AST), never
   an import: the checker must run on a box with no torch and no model weights.
5. **Deferral phrases** — prose that points at a conversation instead of stating
   the substance — come from the `[defer]` section of the same data file. They
   are judgement, not syntax: which idioms bury meaning accumulates as the
   codebase is read, so they are versioned beside the checker rather than frozen
   in it, exactly as the date allowlist is.
6. **Provenance citations** — a section mark, a named arm, a pre-registration, a
   milestone code, a bare item code, a commit hash — come from the `[cite]`
   section of the same file. They are the other half of the deferral rule: a
   deferral points at a conversation, a provenance citation points at a document,
   and outside the tree that held them both leave the reader with nothing to
   open. The code is the receipt for what the code does, and the history of how
   it got here is git's to keep.
7. **Infrastructure references** — prose that presupposes one operator's
   machines or job scheduler — come from the `[infra]` section. The section holds
   SHAPES only: a scheduler's submit command written as a command, a coordinator
   API, work described by which node it runs on. The names of hosts, accounts and
   schedulers are deliberately absent, because a published pattern would have to
   list them and listing them defeats keeping them out; a bare name remains a
   reviewer's catch.

Matching is line-scoped, like the timelessness rules: a referent split across a
line break is not seen. Writing a path on one line is the cheaper half of that
trade.

The patterns for the private trees are written with one character bracketed
(`researc[h]`), so this file does not match itself and is scanned by the gate it
implements.

Usage
-----
    python -m tools.check_referents --root stigmergeia bootstrap node tasks tools tests --json referents.json

`--report-only` prints the same receipt and exits 0 whatever it found; exit 2
still means the check could not run.
